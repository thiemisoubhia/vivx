# ðŸ’œ Vivo API Replica Â· Naomi Soubhia

Welcome to the **Vivo API Replica**, a backend project developed as part of the **Next FIAP** challenge in partnership with **Vivo**. This application replicates part of the API functionalities used by Vivo to manage clients and products â€” with a strong focus on **security**, **database management**, and **API monitoring** using **Microsoft Azure**.

## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

This project was created during the **Next FIAP** event, where students were challenged by **Vivo** to develop a system capable of managing data securely and efficiently, inspired by real corporate APIs.

Our mission:
>  **Replicate the core features of Vivo's internal API**,  
>  Implement **secure access controls**,  
>  Ensure **data consistency** and **relational integrity**,  
>  Use **Microsoft Azure** to deploy, monitor, and manage the API.

The result is a robust backend using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, **JPA**, and **H2**, ready for future scalability and integration with real-world applications.
